# Credit-card-fraud-detection-
This project aims to detect credit card fraud using Python libraries. It utilizes the numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn libraries for data manipulation, preprocessing, and machine learning model implementation.
Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

bash

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd credit-card-fraud-detection

    Run the Python script credit_card_fraud_detection.py:

bash

python credit_card_fraud_detection.py

Dependencies

    numpy: For numerical computations and array manipulation.
    pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
    scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluating their performance.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. It is not included in this repository due to its size. You can obtain the dataset from kaggle.
Approach

    Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables if necessary.

    Model Training: The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets. A logistic regression model is trained on the training set.

    Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the testing set using accuracy score.
